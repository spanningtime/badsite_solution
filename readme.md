# Solution by William Knight

### Time spent: 7 hours

### Run `npm install` and then run `npm start'

I spent an hour longer than the time limit. I know you told me when I interviewed with you that completing the project didn't matter, but I wanted to complete it for myself, and I was actually having fun, so I spent a little extra time finishing it up and getting to know Justin Bieber's fans, which was exhilirating. 

- I fixed everything I noticed in the design. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to attempt to correct some of the styles to accomplish what the original "really bad intern" was intending, but I tried to do that where it made sense and scrapped or adjusted the things that didn't make sense to me.

- Wasn't sure how I was expected to access the json data so I set up a super simple express server to read the file and serve the data.

- This was my first time using Chart.js. I played around with different charts but there's so many data points to display that I thought the bar graph was the best way to represent it.

- I decided to avoid major build tools since it was a small project.



# Code Assessment

### Time Limit: 6 hours

Please try to complete this exercise within six hours. If you're not able to complete it by then, please provide a link to your work along with a list of challenges, reasons why they were a challenge, and how you would overcome them if you had more time. It's more important to see your process and approach than it is to deliver production-ready code (though it doesn't hurt).

I'll be looking for correctness, thoughtfulness, efficiency, and intent.

The goal is to demonstrate your abilities in; 

- parsing and manipulating data

- using a third-party library

- developing responsive, efficient web pages with readable code


## Tasks:

1. Using the files found in `/public`, correct all errors on the web page. The page should be responsive and adhere to strict HTML/CSS/JS standards. Vanilla Javascript is preferred.

2. Build a data structure that captures the count of each word in the content of the "bodyHtml" field(s) from JSON document `/test_feed.json`.

3. Utilize the Chart.js library (http://www.chartjs.org/) to visualize the results on the web page. You're free to implement it in anyway you see fit, including the use of other libraries.

4. Using git, put the files in a publically accesible repo so that the test can be run on a local machine.
